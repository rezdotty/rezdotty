<h2>About Me</h1>

### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚

I am a **Web Developer** who has been developing web and mobile
sites for more than 5 years, across virtually every industry.

Whether you are starting a new project from the ground up or just need existing maintenance to an
existing product, I can work on every aspect of your project (from front-end design to back-end
integration), or just certain parts, based on your specific needs.

My main goals when working with you are simple:
- Clear and consistent communication. I make myself available during all waking hours to provide
status updates, answer and ask questions, and discuss the project. Openness, trust, and friendliness
have been the keys to success in my work.
- Complete satisfaction with the end result. I treat each project as unique and with its own set of
needs. I will work with you along every step of the way to ensure that there are no surprises, and
only satisfaction.
